<h3>About the Conference</h3>
<p>Jointly organised by <strong>Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE)</strong> and
the <strong>International Health Cohorts Consortium (IHCC)</strong>, the
conference will bring together some 600 thought leaders, clinicians, scientists,
biotechs, and patient advocacy associations from across the world who are
at the forefront of precision medicine and public health innovation.</p>
<p>Themed <strong>“From Cohorts to Clinics: The New Landscape of Global Healthcare”</strong>,
the conference seeks to address the challenges and opportunities in translating
advances in precision medicine into tangible enhancements in patient care
and reshape the landscape of modern healthcare. It also aims to catalyse
and promote cross-population cohort research and design cross-cohort pilot
projects to address various global challenges.</p>
<p>The three-day conference will be held <strong>on-site</strong> from <strong>21 to 23 August 2024</strong> in <strong>Singapore</strong>.</p>
<h3>Conference Aims</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>About PRECISE</h3>

central entity set up to coordinate a whole of government effort to implement
Phase 2 of Singapore’s three-phase <strong>National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme</strong>.</p>
<p>It aims to transform healthcare in Singapore and improve patient outcomes
through new insights into the Asian genome and data-driven healthcare solutions.
NPM Phase 2 will also enhance the breadth and depth of the Precision Medicine-related
industry by attracting and anchoring overseas companies in Singapore, while
yielding new opportunities for home-grown companies.</p>
<p>PRECISE is a programme under the Consortium for Clinical Research and
Innovation, Singapore (CRIS). PRECISE is supported by the National Research

<h3>About IHCC</h3>
<p>The <strong>International Health Cohorts Consortium (IHCC)</strong> aims
to create a global platform for translational research – cohort to bedside
and cohort to bench – informing the biological and genetic basis for disease
and improving clinical care and population health.</p>
<p>It brings large cohorts together to encourage data sharing, improve effciencies
and maximise benefits in addressing scientific questions none could answer
alone. To address the value and challenges of combining large cohort data
across borders, the IHCC has formed two working groups:</p>

<li>
<p>Scientific Strategy and Cohorts Enhancement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Standards and Infrastructure.</p>
