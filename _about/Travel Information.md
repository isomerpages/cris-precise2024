<p><strong>Singapore</strong> is a sunny, tropical island in Southeast Asia,
off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It is about 275 square miles
and inhabited by over five million people, of which the resident population
comprises four major communities; Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian.</p>
<p>Ideally positioned in Southeast Asia, Singapore is a thriving metropolis
offering a world-class infrastructure, a fully integrated island-wide transport
network, dynamic business environment, vibrant living spaces and a rich
culture largely influenced by the major communities in Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore has also become <strong>Asiaâ€™s fastest growing bio-cluster base</strong>,
as strategic partnerships between research institutes, corporates, and
public hospitals yield new medicines and therapies for regional and global
markets.</p>
